# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Our main algorithm is completely in the while loop and if blocks. 
In the while loop we continuously play the game until press q for exit the program. 

We have 4 main if blocks and their sub if blocks: 
•	First if block handles draw situation and the agent makes a move randomly.
•	Second if block handles if the human make a move rock. If the human wins, agent make a move paper. If the human loses, agent make a move against human which use the true statistics. 
•	Third if block handles if the human make a move paper. If the human wins, agent make a move scissors. If the human loses, agent make a move against human which use the true statistics.
•	Fourth if block handles if the human make a move scissors. If the human wins, agent make a move rock. If the human loses, agent make a move against human which use the true statistics.
Also code count the scores which player win or lose when press the Q for exit the game then shows the score.
